OK, What we need to do next is scan for various Artifacs within the project

At mimium we want to collect:

    ArtifactType { get; set; } = null!;   // "Controller" (v1)
    LogicalName { get; set; } = null!;    // "ContactsController"
    RelativeFilePath { get; set; } = null!; // "DevHelper/Controllers/ContactsController.cs"

    Namespace { get; set; }
    ClassName { get; set; }              // "ContactsController"
    
    
To start with I am looking for particular types of artifacts:
- Controllers (MVC and API types)
- DBContexts (both standard DbContext and DbIdentityContext types)
- Class files (EF Classes, Viewmodels, api models etc)
- DI Services
(we are delliberately excluding .cshtml files for the moment)


So I think what we need to do (please offer advice) is:
- walk through all directories in the project looking for .cs files
- read the file to identify if it's one I'm looking for,
- if it is, write data to database


At the start write a quick note describing the files types the function is looking for so I can read it later and remeber what it is doing.


FYI: The next step after is to dive deeper into databearing classes such as EF schema models, domain models etc, & Controller ROuting but I'll get to that

Offer any thougts before starting code
