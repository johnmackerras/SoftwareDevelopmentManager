What I am working otowards is the ability to look at a particular class across all of the projects, lets say:
    public abstract class DbContact : DbBaseEntity

Ultimately we will define a report which will show me at Module level, which classes belong to that module and which fields are in that class and the properties of the class.

I will need to group these classes accross the modules. I am writing - to giev you an indication - I have a Contact module, a marketing module, a listing module, etc. For the most part this is manual entry by me but some can be inferred by scan. For example I can tell you that anything called 'this' belongs in the contacts module.


This report will show me somethign like;

Header
Module: Contact
Class: Address

Then I am looking for a table which shows me in column 1, all of the fields which appear in that class across all of the Repositories (in Order of presentation).
Then for the next column it will look at the first repsitory and show me eithr the field type (i.e. string(max)) or three dashes if it does not appear.
I will be able to look along the line horizontally to see a particular field in a module, and wheteher that field eitehr appears in the repo or its type in that repo.
You only need show me the Repo's it appears in.

So it might be

Field			Repo1           Repo2         Repo3        repo4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------                  
ID			long		guid	      ---          string(10)
Name			string(50)      string(50)    string(30)   string(50)


Another type of report might be: modules, features used across repos

 		Contact		Finance		Lisitng
Repo 1		 x              x               x
Repo2            x              -               x


So that's where we are heading, but I don't want you to generate the report now, we just want to gather the data and record it correctly, so this type of report can be drawn up later.



---------------------
I defintely want to record if it is derived from another class, or if it is abstract, static or overrides a base class

I feel it might be wise to record what 'this' is in a definition table. That way it's not hard-cded and I can put it in a Initialiser routine if I flush the database. For the moment, lets define 'this' as being able to group by a classes Repository, Solution and Project, with a 'Grouping' term (string(50)) and a 'Feature' term (string(50) nullable). It needs to be unique accross all fields.

Some fields are configured through annotation and some through fluent, so you may want to update the Artifact collector.

So I would like to be able to see the property, it's type and chachteristics (i.e: string(25) or string(max) [DataType(DataType.MultilineText)], [Required, StringLength(60), Display(Name = "Family name")],  [InverseProperty(nameof(DbContactAssociation.Contact))]). Type can also be another class, often a List<childclass>.

Be aware that there are some custom getter and setters too.

I am OK with the type being shown as 'List<childclass>' or 'string(max)'.

Some classes are database schema and some classes are viewmodels


Can you quick re-iterate this in your own words and ask any questions.
