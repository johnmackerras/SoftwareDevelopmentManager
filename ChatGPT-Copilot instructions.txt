I am writing a new c# solution called "Software Development Manager".

It has three c# projects:
1 - SolutionManager
    The Asp.NET MVC .net10 app designed to allow me to take control of my 7-odd app develments and to find parts easilly
    
2 - SolutionManagerDatabase
    The EntityFramework MS-SQL datastore
    
3 - Terrafirma.Core
    Common components
    
SolutionManager has a dependancy on SolutionManagerDatabase & Terrafirma.Core
SolutionManagerDatabase has a dependancy on Terrafirma.Core


It's purppose is to read the source code of my projects and datbase specific aspects so I can see current and historical methods.

All source code is kept on one root directory on the computer.
    "GitRootPath": "C:\\Development",
    
This folder contains all repositoris from this GithubRoot    
    "DefaultRemoteRepoRootUrl": "https://github.com/johnmackerras/",
    

When giving me code to paste into this application, be clear on which file is to be created/edited and what my action is, give me speciifc instructions (find this code, do this action). DO NOT be abstract, DO NOT provide non-functioning code. DO take your time to make sure code is correct first time.

Keep your responses brief and to the point. DO NOT provide long explainations, although short, oone to two sentaces may be appropriate in context.
  

Application behaviour
- When recording file paths in the database, save the relative path in cluding filename.extension, so you can always get the local by calcualting GitRootPath + relative filepath




Task 1 is to get a list of all Repositories on the local disk. The name of each folder under GitRootPath is the Repository Name
