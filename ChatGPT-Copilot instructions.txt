I am writing a new c# solution called "Software Development Manager". I need oyu to help me write the code.

It has three c# projects:
1 - SolutionManager
    The Asp.NET MVC .net10 app designed to allow me to take control of my 7-odd app developments and to find parts easily
        
2 - SolutionManagerDatabase
    The EntityFramework MS-SQL datastore. It's folder structure is:
    \Configure  - contains EF fluent cofiguration files
    \Context - Contains the EF context
    \Schema - contains the database schema classes
    \Services - contains services which write data in and out of the datastore
    
   
3 - Terrafirma.Core
    Common components.
    
    
SolutionManager has a dependancy on SolutionManagerDatabase & Terrafirma.Core
SolutionManagerDatabase has a dependancy on Terrafirma.Core


It's purpose is to read the source code of my projects and database specific aspects so I can see current and historical methods.

All source code is kept on one root directory on the computer.
    "GitRootPath": "C:\\Development",
    
This folder contains all repositories from this GithubRoot    
    "DefaultRemoteRepoRootUrl": "https://github.com/johnmackerras/",
    

When giving me code to paste into this application, be clear on which file is to be created/edited and what my action is, give me speciifc instructions (find this code, do this action). DO NOT be abstract, DO NOT provide non-functioning code. DO take your time to make sure code is correct first time.

Keep your responses brief and to the point. DO NOT provide long explanations, although short, one to two sentences may be appropriate in context.
  

Application behaviour
- When recording file paths in the database, save the relative path including filename.extension, so you can always get the local by calculating GitRootPath + relative file path


Task 1 is to get a list of all Repositories on the local disk. The name of each folder under GitRootPath is the Repository Name

We need to create Solution Scanning service, which does the following:

1. Get the Repository ifnormation

- Gets the list of folders under GitRootPath. Each folder represents a Github repository.
- if the .git directory exists, extract
  -- RepositoryName
  -- RepositoryUrl
  -- RepositoryProvider
  -- IsPrivateRepo
  -- GitFirstCommitUtc
  -- GitLastCommitUtc
  -- GitHeadSha
  -- DefaultBranch
  -- CurrentBranch
  
If the RepositoryName cannot be extracted from the .git, the use the Foldername instead.

2. Gets the solution information
If the solution is a c# solution, the repo direcotry should contain either a *.sln or *.slnx file to read. It could be a .NetFramwork, .Net or .NetCore solution.
Ee need to collect this information about the solution.

Name 
Description - extracted from the reeadme.md is available

CreatedOn  - probably from .git if notwhere else

SolutionFilePath // relative to repo root, e.g. "DevHelper.sln"
SolutionFile  // e.g. "DevHelper.sln"
ProjectType { get; set; }       // freeform: "MVC", "MAUI", "JS"
RuntimePlatform { get; set; }   // ".NET", "Node.js"
RuntimeVersion { get; set; }    // "10.0"

3. We should be able to then get a list of projects fromthe soluton file.
That should contain a .csproj file, which should help us indentify these

RelativeProjectPath { get; set; } = null!;
ProjectType { get; set; }
TargetFrameworks { get; set; }

Platform { get; set; }
UiStack { get; set; }

IsWebApp { get; set; }
IsClassLibrary { get; set; }
IsTestProject { get; set; }
